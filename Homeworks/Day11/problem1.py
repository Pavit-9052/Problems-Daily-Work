'''Problem #1
1. Check whether the given string input is a valid ip address.
Find out what are the constraints for an ip address (how many chars, what numbers are allowed, how many '.'
etc)
Write all constraints.
Get an input as string. Return if it is valid or not. 
Use string functions.'''

'''
An IPv4 address is a string in decimal-dot notation, consisting of four decimal integers in the
inclusive range 0â€“255, separated by dots (e.g. 192.168.0.1).


An IPv6 address is represented by eight groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by colons, where each group represents 16 bits.
The range value exceeds from 0 to FFFF.
